The design is based on a cubic oscillation with a subtle distortion through the form. Finn is made from 98% recycled bioplastic (the remaining 2% is the white tint). The material used was originally produced from corn starch then recycled again from food packaging giving a second life in a much longer living product. Finn fits a standard threaded E27 bulb holder (40mm diameter). For example it will fit the IKEA Skaftet E27 floor lamp base or the Sunneby E27 pendant cord. You can also use Finn with smaller fittings like an E14 or B22. You just need to combine the fitting with a reducer ring. Dimensions: W165mm x D165mm x H165mm Please use energy-saving light bulbs or LED light bulbs only with a maximum of 11 watts. Manufactured in London, UK. We care about our impact on the planet so we ship our products with 100% recyclable packaging and labels.</g:description><g:link>https://www.formeleven.com/products/finn-lamp-shade.html</g:link><g:brand>Form Eleven</g:brand><g:identifier_exists>no</g:identifier_exists><g:condition>new</g:condition><g:availability>in_stock</g:availability><g:price>90.0 GBP</g:price><g:shipping><g:country>UK</g:country><g:service>Standard</g:service><g:price>0.00 GBP</g:price></g:shipping><g:google_product_category>Home &amp; Garden > Lighting Accessories > Lampshades</g:google_product_category><g:image_link>https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0617/8750/4835/products/DSCF0739_1024x1024.jpg?v=1655116467</g:image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0617/8750/4835/products/DSCF0740_1024x1024.jpg?v=1655116467</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0617/8750/4835/products/DSCF1093_1024x1024.jpg?v=1655116467</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0617/8750/4835/products/DSCF1124_1024x1024.jpg?v=1655116467</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0617/8750/4835/products/DSCF0677_1024x1024.jpg?v=1655116467</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0617/8750/4835/products/finn-dimensions-side_1024x1024.jpg?v=1655116467</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0617/8750/4835/products/finn-dimensions-top_1024x1024.jpg?v=1655116467</g:additional_image_link></item><item><g:id>7260085158083</g:id><g:title>Ripple Lamp Shade</g:title><g:description>Ripple is a 3D printed lamp shade made completely from recycled bioplastic.
